# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Tableau Project
📌 Project Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive data analytics project designed to help HR managers analyze workforce data through both high-level summaries and detailed employee-level records. Built using Tableau, this dashboard enables data-driven decision-making related to hiring, attrition, demographics, and compensation.

The project simulates a real-world HR environment using a synthetically generated dataset of 8,950 employee records, making it suitable for portfolio demonstration and practical analytics learning.
